# Discord-exporting-script
This bash script is made to perfectly archive a discord server. It requires Tyrzz discord chat exporter.
I have created this template in the hopes many other people use it, it creates a layout that aims to be as close as the original server is currently shown. Putting the server name on a folder, followed by category folders, and finally the channels of each numbered in order.

FOLDER STRUCTURE: The script creates the following directory structure.

        /'Server name' [Last week date]-[Today's date]/

        |---> [Category position] Category name/

                |---> [Channel position] Channel name.html

                |---> [Channel position] Channel name.html
